This is the folder where you should save logs and checkpoints during training.

By default it includes three files:
- `pip.txt`: This shows the pip dependencies installed in the container when it ran.
- `test_tf.txt`: This shows the output from running `test_tf.py`.
- `index.txt`: This shows the output from running `index.py`.
